## What is Shuriken UI Tailwind?

```


## New contributor guide

This package provide a [Tailwind CSS preset](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets) which contains all the components and utilities. It also extend the default theme with some colors and fonts.

All the components are separated in their own [Tailwind CSS plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins) and can be configured in the `tailwind.config.ts` file, so you can easily customize each component.

If you find a bug or want to add new features, makes sure to check if it has an impact on Shuriken UI Nuxt. If it does, make sure to submit a PR to all the projects.

Also, note that we use `release/next` branch to develop new features. If you want to contribute, make sure to create a new branch from `release/next` and to submit your pull request to `release/next` branch. (see [Git conventions](#git-conventions))

If you have any doubt or questions, feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/shuriken-ui/tailwind/discussions).


## Setup the project

We haven't published the test project yet. For now, you can follow the steps described in the [Shuriken UI Nuxt](https://github.com/shuriken-ui/nuxt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#setup-the-project) project to tests your changes in the playground.

## Submitting your changes

Once you are done with your changes, you can submit a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Make sure the tests pass locally by running `pnpm test`, this will run the linter.
- Make sure to create a draft PR if it's not ready to be merged, see [how to change stage of a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request)
- Make sure to add a description of your changes, if relevant, add screenshots or gifs to illustrate your changes.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Shuriken UI maintainer will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

Make sure to prefix your commit with one of the following types:
`fix:`, `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`

Use the imperative, present tense: ‚Äúchange‚Äù _not ‚Äúchanged‚Äù nor ‚Äúchanges‚Äù_.
